# JavaScript and the DOM #

1. Create an HTML file using the following HTML

```
<!doctype HTML>
<html>
<body>

<h1>About Me</h1>
  
<ul>
	<li>Nickname: <span id="nickname"></span>
	<li>Favorites:  <span id="favorites"></span>
	<li>Hometown: <span id="hometown"></span>
</ul> 

</body>
</html> 

```

2. Link it to a JavaScript file that you will edit

## Using the JavaScript file *only* (not using a CSS file) ##

1. Change the background color of the entire document to red
2. Change the background color of just the "about me" portion to blue
3. Change the font-style of the entire document to sans-serif
4. Add your nickname 
5. Add your favorites
6. Add your hometown

## Extra Credit (still only using JavaScript) ##

1. Iterate through each li and change the class to "listitem". Add a style tag that sets a rule for "listitem" to make the color red.
2. Create a new `img` element and set its src attribute to a picture of you. Append that element to the page.
